Instructions to run Code:

	Current version: PyCharm 2020.3.3
	Build number: PY-203.7148.72
	My development platform is MSI 15.6" GF63. on Windows 11


	Open this project in PyCharm. Make sure it's not to out of date.

	In pycharm type CTRL+ALT+S, and  go to the  Project: Project04 Knapsack.

	Set your python Interpreter to be (Python 3.8). Next you wanna  click the + button on the bottom left in the Python Interpreter directory
	and add matplotlib to you libraries.

	or you can simply run this on blue
	------------------------
	python main.py caseID
    ------------------------


	The case-ID's are prefixed with _v, _c and _w to indicate the values, total capcity and weights

	
	Solved Knapsack problem using the Traditional Dynamic Programming Approach, Memory Function method, and using the Memory Function using a open cahin hash 		table.
	
	A greedy approach sorted based on it's "bank for buck ration" aka value/weight, was also implmented using merge sort.
	The last approach solves the problem using a max heap, and heapifies it bottom up, and then proceeds to do a variable amount of log(n) operations to find th 		optimal subset.
